## Setup of euler2
In the following, three alternative ways to setup and use euler2 are described. The order is from most to least convenient.
1. Jupyterhub
   1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/EulerProject/e3-jupyterhub/issues) stating your github username and the wish to have an account created. Wait for response from an admin on the created issue. 
   2. [Visit Jupyterhub @ eyeofjupyter.org](https://eyeofjupyter.org/)
   3. Optionally organize your input files via new file/folder or file upload.
   3. Create a new bash notebook (or other, depending on your preference), to run euler2 commands.
2. Docker image
   1. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
   2. Run `docker run rodenhausen\e3-docker-image`
   3. Run euler2 commands in the container
3. Manual installation
